## How to Test

1. **Set up OpenAI API key** (see OPENAI_SETUP.md)
2. **Add credits to your OpenAI account** if quota exceeded
3. **Start the development server**
4. **Open the AI chat widget** by clicking the AI icon in the bottom right

   - "How do I start the time?"
   - "How do I add a project?"
   - "Where are my reports?"
6. **Observe the AI responses** tailored to your application

## Example Usage

```
User: How do I start the time?
AI: To start tracking time in Task Flow Pro:

1. Look for the clock icon (🕐) in the left sidebar and click it to go to the Time Tracker page
2. You have two options:
   a) Quick Timer: Click the large "Start Timer" button at the top
   b) Manual Entry: Click "Add Time Entry" to create a detailed entry
3. For the Quick Timer:
   - It will start timing immediately
   - You can add project/task details while it's running
   - Click "Stop" when you're done
4. For Manual Entry:
   - Select a project from the dropdown (required)
   - Select a task if applicable
   - Add a description of what you're working on
   - Set the time manually or set the timer
   - Click "Start" to begin timing or save manually
```

```
User: How do I do this?
AI: I'd be happy to help you with Task Flow Pro! To give you the most accurate instructions, could you please tell me more about what you're trying to accomplish? For example:

- Are you trying to track time for a project?
- Do you need to create a new project or task?
- Are you looking for reports or analytics?
- Do you need to manage team members?
- Are you trying to change your settings?

Once you provide more details, I can give you step-by-step instructions.
```

## Security Notes

The current implementation uses `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` which exposes your API key in the browser. This is only suitable for development purposes. For production, you should:

1. Create a backend proxy endpoint that calls the OpenAI API
2. Remove `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` from the OpenAI configuration
3. Call your backend endpoint instead of the OpenAI API directly

## Removed Features

The following team messaging features have been removed:
- Team-based messaging
- User mentions (@mentions)
- Message reactions
- Message editing/deletion
- Team selection
- Unread message counts
