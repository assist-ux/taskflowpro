# AI Integration in Messaging Widget

This document explains how the AI integration works in the messaging widget and how to use it.

## Features

1. **AI Assistant in Chat**: Users can interact with an AI assistant directly in the chat widget
2. **Natural Language Processing**: The AI can understand and respond to natural language queries
3. **Context-Aware Responses**: The AI provides helpful responses based on the user's input

## How to Use

1. **Open the Chat Widget**: Click on the chat icon in the bottom right corner of the screen
2. **Trigger AI Mode**: Start your message with `/ai` followed by your question
   - Example: `/ai How can I improve team productivity?`
   - Example: `/ai What are the best practices for project management?`
3. **View AI Response**: The AI response will appear in the chat as a message from "AI Assistant"

## Implementation Details

### Components Modified

1. **MessagingWidget.tsx**: 
   - Added state for AI processing and responses
   - Implemented AI query detection
   - Added UI elements to display AI responses
   - Integrated with OpenAI service

2. **OpenAI Service**: 
   - Created a service to handle OpenAI API calls
   - Implemented error handling and response processing

### How It Works

1. When a user sends a message starting with `/ai`, the widget detects this pattern
2. The message text (excluding the `/ai` prefix) is sent to the OpenAI service
3. The OpenAI service makes a call to the OpenAI API
4. The response is displayed in the chat as a message from the AI Assistant

### Technical Architecture

```
User Input -> MessagingWidget -> OpenAI Service -> OpenAI API -> Response -> UI Display
```

## Configuration

To enable the AI features, you need to:

1. Set up an OpenAI API key (see OPENAI_SETUP.md)
2. Configure the environment variables
3. Restart the development server

## Security Considerations

- The current implementation exposes the API key in the browser, which is only suitable for development
- For production, implement a backend proxy to handle API calls
- Never commit API keys to version control

## Future Enhancements

1. **Conversation History**: Maintain context across multiple AI interactions
2. **Custom AI Models**: Allow selection of different AI models
3. **Team-Specific Knowledge**: Integrate team-specific information into AI responses
4. **Voice Input**: Add voice-to-text capabilities for AI queries
5. **Response Actions**: Allow AI to suggest actions based on responses
