# Sound Notification Feature Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of custom sound notifications for the Clockistry application. The feature provides a distinctive audio alert when users receive mention notifications in chat or comments.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Sound Generation
The sound notification system uses the Web Audio API to dynamically generate a pleasant "ding" sound without requiring external audio files. The implementation creates a harmonic combination of two sine wave oscillators:

- **880Hz** (A5 note) - Main tone
- **1320Hz** (E6 note) - Perfect fifth harmonic

### 2. Key Components

#### Sound Utility Functions (`src/utils/soundUtils.ts`)
- `playNotificationSound()`: Creates and plays the notification sound
- `playTestSound()`: Wrapper function for testing the sound

#### Notification Context (`src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`)
- Integrated sound playback into the existing notification system
- Plays sound automatically when mention notifications are received
- Plays sound when new unread mentions are detected

#### Settings Integration (`src/components/settings/NotificationSettings.tsx`)
- Added UI controls for enabling/disabling sound notifications
- Test button to preview the notification sound
- Settings are persisted in localStorage

#### Settings Page (`src/pages/Settings.tsx`)
- Integrated the new notification settings component
- Users can access sound notification controls in the Notifications tab

### 3. User Experience

#### Enabling/Disabling Sounds
Users can toggle sound notifications through the Settings page:
1. Navigate to Settings → Notifications
2. Toggle the "Sound Notifications" switch
3. Changes are automatically saved to localStorage

#### Testing Sounds
Users can test the notification sound:
1. Navigate to Settings → Notifications
2. Click the "Test Notification Sound" button
3. Hear the sound if enabled

#### Automatic Playback
Sounds play automatically when:
- A user is mentioned in a chat message
- A user is mentioned in a comment or note
- New unread mention notifications are detected

### 4. Technical Considerations

#### Browser Compatibility
The implementation uses the Web Audio API, which is supported in all modern browsers:
- Chrome 10+
- Firefox 25+
- Safari 6+
- Edge 12+

#### Performance
- No external audio files required
- Lightweight implementation (~1KB of code)
- Sounds are generated on-demand
- Minimal impact on application performance

#### Privacy
- All sound generation happens client-side
- No external requests for audio files
- User preferences stored locally

### 5. Customization

#### Sound Parameters
The sound can be customized by modifying the frequencies in `soundUtils.ts`:
```typescript
// Main tone frequency (Hz)
oscillator1.frequency.setValueAtTime(880, audioContext.currentTime)

// Harmonic frequency (Hz)
oscillator2.frequency.setValueAtTime(1320, audioContext.currentTime)
```

#### Duration
The sound duration can be adjusted by changing the stop times:
```typescript
// Sound duration (seconds)
oscillator1.stop(audioContext.currentTime + 0.4)
oscillator2.stop(audioContext.currentTime + 0.4)
```

### 6. Testing

#### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to `/sound-test` route
2. Toggle sound notifications on/off
3. Click "Play Test Sound" button
4. Verify sound plays when enabled and is silent when disabled

#### Automated Testing
Unit tests are located in `src/utils/soundUtils.test.ts` and cover:
- Sound playback when enabled
- Silence when disabled
- Error handling for unsupported browsers

### 7. Future Enhancements

#### Sound Variations
Different sounds could be implemented for different notification types:
- Mentions
- Direct messages
- System alerts
- Task updates

#### Volume Control
Add user-adjustable volume settings:
- Master volume control
- Notification-specific volume
- Mute during specific hours

#### Sound Themes
Provide different sound themes:
- Classic (current implementation)
- Modern
- Minimal
- Custom user uploads

## Conclusion
The sound notification feature provides a pleasant, distinctive audio alert for mention notifications while maintaining privacy and performance. The implementation is lightweight, customizable, and compatible with all modern browsers.
