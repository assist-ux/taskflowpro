# AI-Only Chat Widget

This document explains the new AI-only chat widget that replaces the previous team messaging functionality.

## Features

1. **Pure AI Interaction**: Dedicated widget for interacting with an AI assistant
2. **No Team Messaging**: Removed all team-based messaging features
3. **Persistent Chat History**: Messages are stored in the widget session
4. **Resizable Interface**: Adjust the widget size to your preference
5. **Clear Chat Function**: Easily clear the conversation history

## How to Use

3. **Send Message**: Press Enter or click the send button
4. **View Response**: The AI response will appear as a message from "AI Assistant"
5. **Continue Conversation**: Ask follow-up questions or start new topics

## Key Differences from Previous Implementation

### Removed Features

- Message reactions
- Message editing/deletion
- Team selection
- Unread message counts

### Added Features
- Simplified interface focused solely on AI interaction
- Clear chat button to reset conversation
- Improved resizing functionality
- Dedicated AI styling

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
- **File**: `src/components/ai/AIChatWidget.tsx`
- **Dependencies**: Uses the existing `openaiService`
- **State Management**: Manages its own message history and UI state

### Data Model
```typescript
interface AIChatMessage {
  id: string
  role: 'user' | 'assistant'
  content: string
  timestamp: Date
}
```

### Key Functions
1. `callOpenAI()` - Handles API calls to OpenAI service
2. `handleSendMessage()` - Processes user input and AI responses
3. `clearChat()` - Resets the conversation history

## UI Elements

1. **Toggle Button**: AI icon in bottom-right corner
2. **Main Widget**: Chat interface with message history
3. **Header**: Title and clear button
4. **Message Area**: Scrollable conversation display
5. **Input Area**: Text input with send button
6. **Resize Handle**: Drag to adjust widget height

## Storage

- Widget height is saved in localStorage as `aiChatWidgetHeight`
- Message history is kept in component state (not persisted between sessions)

## Styling

- Follows the same dark/light mode theming as the rest of the application
- Distinct styling for user vs AI messages
- Loading indicators during AI processing
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
